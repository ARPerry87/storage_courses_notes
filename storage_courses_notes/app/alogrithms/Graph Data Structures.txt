DFT and BFT 
	- DFT 
		- Start from the source and go deep in one direction 
	- BFT - you visit nodes closest to the start first and then nodes further away until you visit all of the nodes 

	- In a graph multiple paths can lead to an end node 

	- Graphs can have cycles so the node can be visited multiple times 

	- Traversals can be infinite so need to keep track 

	- Depth first Traversal 
		- start off at source and go as deep as possible before coming back

		- Simple array tracks already visited nodes 
	- BFT - Level - wise manner traversal. 
		- 1 - level deep, then 2, then 3.
