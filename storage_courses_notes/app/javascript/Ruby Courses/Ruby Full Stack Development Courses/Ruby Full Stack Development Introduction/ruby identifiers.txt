Local variable - convention to keep lowercase and seperate by _. These variables are local to the code construct in which they are declared. A local variable is only accessible within the block of its initialization. Local variables are not available outside the method. 

Instance variables are - the basic storage and retrival mechanism for values that relate to individual objects. An instance variables enables an instance object to remember states. They function similar to other variables. Instance are only visible to the object they belong to and an instance variable inside a class can be used by any method defined within that same class.
