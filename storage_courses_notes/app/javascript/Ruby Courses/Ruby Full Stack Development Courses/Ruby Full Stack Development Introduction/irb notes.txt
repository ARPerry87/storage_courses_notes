irb notes 

type irb to enter interactive ruby prompt 

use it like you would use a ruby file but have it act dynamically 
doesn't respond to bash or shell commands so it isn't a shell or bash line response

to exit type exit

open irb config file to configure it (duh) uncomment system cls for clearing screen

irb --simple-prompt for starting it with simple prompt
