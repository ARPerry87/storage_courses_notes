Bubble sort 
	- We'll be taking either the largest or the smallest element and moving it to the right or the left 
		- [T, G, W, P, K, D, M]
			- We'll be moving the largest elements to the right 
			- Where the M is that's where the W should be 

			- First round, look at the T and the G 

			- The T and the G aren't in the right order

			[T, G] wrong
			[G, T] Right 

			Now we check the next two and move down the index 

			[G, T, W, P, K, D, M]

			[W, P] Wrong 
			[P, W] Right 

			[G, T, P, W, K, D, M]

			Now we keep doing this until it's sorted how we want it to be 

			[W, K] Wrong 
			[K, W] Right 

			[W, D] Nope
			[W, M] Still no
			[M, W] finally! 

			this is just the first iteration through the bubble array, getting just the W to it's proper sort. 

			But, the process is the same.
