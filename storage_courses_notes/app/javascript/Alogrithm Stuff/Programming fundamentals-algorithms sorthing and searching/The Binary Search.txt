Binary Search 
	- Array 
	- Binary search will work best if it's ordered 
	- Bi suggests the number 2 
	- Splits in 2 
	- [D, G, K, M, P, T, W]
	- If looking for G, then when doing a binary search, you would be able to elimnate at M to the right, as G is less than M, so G must be in the left half of the array 

	- [D, G, K] 

	- The left half is selected to be 1 minus the first half so k is in this case and the beginning of the first half, i.e. D

	- We split this sublist again, and we check the element again, and we find that it's the element we're looking for again 

	- Much more effecient than linear search
