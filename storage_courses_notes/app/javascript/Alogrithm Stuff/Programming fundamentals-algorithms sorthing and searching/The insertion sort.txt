Insertion Sort 
	-Immediately consider the first element to be sorted
	- We check that element to the one next to it and see if it needs to be swapped 
	- If we swap those then we have those two then we don't need to worry about those, then we check the second element against the third element
	- Then the Third against the Fourth 
	- Keep swapping until everything is sorted
