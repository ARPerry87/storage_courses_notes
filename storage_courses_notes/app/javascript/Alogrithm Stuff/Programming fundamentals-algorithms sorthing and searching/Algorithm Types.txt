-Brute Force Type
	- Tried all types of solutions, last resort 
	- Trial and error 
- Greedy Algrotihm 
	- Optimization problems 
	- Min and max issues (Excels solver issues)
	- Sizing tiles 
- Recursive 
	- Repeat a block of steps until a solution is found 
	- Calculating greatest common factor 
- Backtracking 
	- Incremental steps to find solution 
	- One part at a time, move backwards until we find solution 

- Brute force 
	- Any problem 
- Greedy 
	- Sorting and scheduling
- Recursive 
	- Certain math problems 
- Backtracking 
	- generating binary strings 

Simple linear search 
	- take a collection of data and check each element in collection 
Binary search 
	- Take a collection of data and sort it, and will only work on sorted data, and chop the mass in half, and decide which half you want to look at. 
		- Then split it again and look at the data again 
			- Keeps splitting until you find what element you want 
Bubble sort
	- Checks the adjacent elements and when it finds the adjacent elements it'll swap the elements if they're in the wrong order. 
		- and it'll keep doing this until everything is sorted properly 
Selection sort
	- Start off and assume that the first element is considered sorted
		- Check the next element, and assume the next element, and continue to do so until the entire list is sorted.
