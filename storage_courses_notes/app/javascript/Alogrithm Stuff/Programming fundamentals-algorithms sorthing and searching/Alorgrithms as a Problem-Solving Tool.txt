Start 
	Declare variables a, b, and c
	Read variables a, b, and c 
	If a > b 
	Then check if a > c 
		Display a is the largest number 
	Otherwise, display c is the largest number 
	If b > c 
		Display b is the largest number 
	Otherwise, display c is the greatest number 
stop

Look at if the first number is larger than the middle, 
if so, then look at if it's larger than the last? It it is
Then A is the biggets number, if not, then C is! 
Otherwise, if B is larger than c, show B is the largest 
otherwise display that yet again the last number is 
the largest, and stop the loop. 

Start
	Declare variable number, f, i
	Read number 
	Initialize variable f = 1 and i = 1 
	Repeat until i<=number 
	f = f*i
	i=i+1
	print f
stop

Print the value of F each time the loop goes around. 
We won't be doing it indefinitely, and we set a limit, 
Which is i, and we'll be counting it each time. We'll be 
Repeating the two middle lines until that i becomes 
the number that the user gives us, until i becomes that 
number.
