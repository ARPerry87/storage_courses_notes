- Properties of an algorithm 
	- inputs and outputs 
	- Steps to solve the problem 
	- Effective 
	- Agnostic 
- Algorithm vs Psuedocode 
	- An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a given problem 
		- a systematic and logical apprcoach where the procedure is defined step-wise 
		- Such as baking a cake and putting on frosting (step wise)
	- A Psuedocode is a method of developing an algrothin 
		- it is written in plain language and uses short phrases to write the funcationaliteis of a specific line of code
