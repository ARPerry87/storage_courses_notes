Building webapps and learning to think in react 
- Showing products in stock and user interface and the hierachy of what's shown 
	- The filtered products table in the search bar table that's been sorted is the top of the hiearchy 
		- it's broken down into nested subcomponents not into one monolithic compnonent
		- Search bar and check box for example 
		- The lower part can be thought of the product table which displays the products that match the search function we have completed and what's available
		- Can be nested into further subcomponents such as sporting goods, electronics, phones, etc. 
		- Individual products can be their own subcomponent 
		- granularlity is up to the programmer
	- The component tree all comes together for form the interface 
	- Each component should only have a single responsiblity and thus is granular
