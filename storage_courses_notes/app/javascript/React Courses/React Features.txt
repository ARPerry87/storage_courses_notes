React Features
- React is a declarative framework - design views associated with state, as state changes the views will update automatically. 
- Component based - encapsulated compnonets that manage their own state. 
- Perfomant - uses a virtual representation of the DOM which is reconciled with an actual DOM 
	- only rerenders changes that have actually taken places inside of the DOM rather than rerendering all DOM nodes to save performance hits
- Server side rendering - with Node and communication using one-way data flow - data flows from the top level compnonent to the lower level compnonent 
- React native - For mobile application
